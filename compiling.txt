On MS Windows, in MSVC++7:

In Project Properties:
1. In C/C++ - General
   Add the Additional Include Directory where the oci.h file is located
   (it can be something like C:\Oracle\Ora81\oci\include).
2. In Linker - General
   Add the Additional Library Directory where the oci.lib file is located
   (it can be something like C:\Oracle\Ora81\oci\lib\msvc).
3. In Linker - Input
   Add the Additional Dependency: oci.lib.

When executing programs, the oci.dll file should be located in the path
where it can be found. Be careful when using many different Oracle tools,
because they may overwrite each other's oci.dll versions.
The "correct" oci.dll for running the program compiled as above is located
somewhere near the oci.lib, for example in C:\Oracle\Ora81\BIN.


On Unix-like systems:

The OCI library is usually inside the libclntsh.so or libclntsh.sl library
(depending on the actual system), so you have to add the -lclntsh option
for linking and -L option to provide the path to the linker.
Of course, the -I compiler option will be needed to provide the location
of the oci.h header file.
Look inside the $ORACLE_HOME directory to find where these files are located
- it may depend both on the Unix flavour and the Oracle version installed,
but likely locations are $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/demo for oci.h
and $ORACLE_HOME/lib for libclntsh.so.
