<h4><a name="files"></a>Files</h4>
<p>The whole SOCI library consists of only two files: <code>soci.h</code>
and <code>soci.cpp</code>. The first needs to be <code>#include</code>d
in your own code and the second should be just added to the whole
project for compilation and linking. There was no reason to make a
precompiled library out of this single file. </p>
<p>Everything in SOCI is declared in the namespace <code>SOCI</code>.
All the following examples assume that your code begins with something
like: </p>
<pre>#include "soci.h"<br>// other includes<br><br>using namespace SOCI;<br><br>// ...<br></pre>
<h4><a name="errors"></a>Errors</h4>
<p>All DB-related errors manifest themselves as exceptions of type <code>SOCIError</code>,
which is derived from <code>std::runtime_error</code>. This allows to
handle Oracle errors within the standard exception framework: </p>
<pre>int main()<br>{<br>    try<br>    {<br>        // regular code<br>    }<br>    catch (exception const &amp;e)<br>    {<br>        cerr &lt;&lt; "Bang! " &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; endl;<br>    }<br>}<br></pre>
<p>In addition, the <code>SOCIError</code> class has a public <code>errNum_</code>
member, which contains the Oracle error code. Of course, in order to
access this code you have to <code>catch</code> the exception as <code>SOCIError</code>:
</p>
<pre>int main()<br>{<br>    try<br>    {<br>        // regular code<br>    }<br>    catch (SOCIError const &amp;e)<br>    {<br>        cerr &lt;&lt; "Oracle error: " &lt;&lt; e.errNum_<br>             &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; endl;<br>    }<br>    catch (exception const &amp;e)<br>    {<br>        cerr &lt;&lt; "Some other error: " &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; endl;<br>    }<br>}<br></pre>
<h4><a name="connecting"></a>Connecting to the database</h4>
<p>The class <code>Session</code> encapsulates the database connection
and other OCI-related details, which are common to all the statements
that will be later executed. Its constructor expects three string
parameters, which are service name, user name and password: </p>
<pre>Session sql("service", "user", "password");<br></pre>
<p>The constructor either connects successfully, or throws the
exception.
It is possible to have many active <code>Session</code>s at the same
time. </p>
<h4><a name="onetimestmts"></a>One-time statements</h4>
<p>In many cases, the SQL query is intended to be executed only once,
which means that statement parsing and execution can go together.
The <code>Session</code> class provides a special <code>once</code>
member, which triggers parsing and execution of such one-time
statements: </p>
<pre>sql.once &lt;&lt; "drop table person";<br></pre>
<p>For shorter syntax, the following form is also allowed: </p>
<pre>sql &lt;&lt; "drop table person";<br></pre>
<p>The IOStream-like interface is exactly what it looks like, so that
the
statement text can be composed of many parts, involving anything that
is <i>streamable</i> (including custom classes, if they have
appropriate <code>operator&lt;&lt;</code>): </p>
<pre>string tableName = "person";<br>sql &lt;&lt; "drop table " &lt;&lt; tableName;<br></pre>
<h4><a name="bindinglocal"></a>Binding local data</h4>
<p><b>Note:</b><br>
The Oracle documentation uses two terms: <i>defining</i> (for
instructing the library where the <i>output</i> data should go) and <i>binding</i>
(for the <i>input</i> data and <i>input/output</i> PL/SQL
parameters). For the sake of simplicity, SOCI uses the term <i>binding</i>
for both of these. </p>
<p><b>Binding output data:</b> </p>
<p>The <code>into</code> expression is used to add binding info to the
statement: </p>
<pre>int count;<br>sql &lt;&lt; "select count(*) from person", into(count);<br><br>string name;<br>sql &lt;&lt; "select name from person where id = 7", into(name);<br></pre>
<p><b>Binding input data:</b> </p>
<p>The <code>use</code> expression is used (no pun intended) to
associate the SQL placeholder (written with colon) with the local data:
</p>
<pre>int val = 7;<br>sql &lt;&lt; "insert into numbers(val) values(:val)", use(val);<br></pre>
<p>In the above statement, the first "val" is a column name (assuming
that
there is appropriate table), the second "val" (with colon) is a
placeholder and its name is ignored here, and the third "val" is a name
of local variable.<br>
To better understand the meaning of each "val" above, consider also: </p>
<pre>int number = 7;<br>sql &lt;&lt; "insert into numbers(val) values(:blabla)", use(number);<br></pre>
<p><b>Binding by position</b> </p>
<p>If there is more output or input "holes" in the single statement, it
is possible to use many <code>into</code> and <code>use</code>
expressions, separated by commas, where each expression will be
responsible for the consecutive "hole" in the statement: </p>
<pre>string firstName = "John", lastName = "Smith";<br>int personId = 7;<br><br>sql &lt;&lt; "insert into person(id, firstname, lastname) values(:id, :fn, :ln)",<br>       use(personId), use(firstName), use(lastName);<br><br>sql &lt;&lt; "select firstname, lastname from person where id = :id",<br>       into(firstName), into(lastName), use(personId);<br></pre>
<p>In the code above, the order of "holes" in the SQL statement and the
order of <code>into</code> and <code>use</code> expression should
match. </p>
<p><b>Binding by name</b> </p>
<p>The SQL placeholders that have their names (with colon) can be bound
by name.<br>
This allows to use different order: </p>
<pre>string firstName = "John", lastName = "Smith";<br>int personId = 7;<br>sql &lt;&lt; "insert into person(id, firstname, lastname) values(:id, :fn, :ln)",<br>       use(firstName, "fn"), use(lastName, "ln"), use(personId, "id");<br></pre>
<p>or bind the same local data to many "holes" at the same time: </p>
<pre>string addr = "...";<br>sql &lt;&lt; "update person"<br>       " set mainaddress = :addr, contactaddress = :addr"<br>       " where id = 7",<br>       use(addr, "addr);<br></pre>
<p><b>Types:</b> </p>
<p>The following types are currently supported for use with <code>into</code>
and <code>use</code> expressions: </p>
<ul>
  <li><code>char</code>, <code>short</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>unsigned
long</code>, <code>double</code> (for numeric values)</li>
  <li><code>char*</code>, <code>char[]</code>, <code>std::string</code>
(for string values)</li>
  <li><code>std::tm</code>, <code>std::time_t</code> (for datetime
values)</li>
  <li><code>SOCI::Statement</code> (for nested statements and PL/SQL
cursors)</li>
  <li><code>SOCI::BLOB</code> (for Binary Large OBjects)</li>
  <li><code>SOCI::RowID</code> (for row identifiers)</li>
</ul>
<p>See the test code that accompanies the library to see how each of
these types is used. </p>
<p>The library can be extended to support other types (including
user-defined classes). The extension points are the <code>IntoType&lt;T&gt;</code>
and <code>UseType&lt;T&gt;</code>
class templates, which specializations can be user-provided. These
specializations need to implement the interface defined by,
respectively, the <code>IntoTypeBase</code> and <code>UseTypeBase</code>
classes.<br>
Note that when specializing these template classes for handling your
own types, you are free to choose the expected parameters for the
classes' constructors. The template functions <code>into</code> and <code>use</code>
support up to 5 parameters, which are just forwarded to the constructor
of appropriate class. The only convention is that when the indicator
variable is used (see below), it should appear in the second position.
Please refer to the library source code to see how this is done for the
standard types. </p>
<h4><a name="indicators"></a>Indicators</h4>
<p>In order to support null values and other conditions which are not
real errors, the concept of <i>indicator</i> is provided.<br>
For example, when the following SQL query is executed: </p>
<pre>select name from person where id = 7<br></pre>
<p>there are three possible outcomes: </p>
<ol>
  <li>there is a person with id = 7 and his name is returned</li>
  <li>there is a person with id = 7, but he has no name (his name is
null)</li>
  <li>there is no such person</li>
</ol>
<p>Whereas the first alternative is easy, the other two are more
complex. Moreover, they are not necessarily errors from the
application's point of view and what's more interesting, they are <i>different</i>
and the application may wish to detect which is the case.<br>
The following example does this: </p>
<pre>string name;<br>eIndicator ind;<br><br>sql &lt;&lt; "select name from person where id = 7", into(name, ind);<br><br>switch (ind)<br>{<br>case eOK:<br>    // the data was returned without problems<br>    break;<br>case eNoData:<br>    // no such person<br>    break;<br>case eNull:<br>    // there is a person, but he has no name (his name is null)<br>    break;<br>case eTruncated:<br>    // the name was returned only in part,<br>    // because the provided buffer was too short<br>    // (not possible with std::string, but possible with char* and char[])<br>    break;<br>}<br></pre>
<p>The use of indicator variable is optional, but if it is not used and
the result would be either <code>eNoData</code> or <code>eNull</code>,
then the exception is thrown. This means that you should use indicator
variables everywhere where the application logic (and database schema)
allow "no such object" or "attribute not set" conditions. </p>
<p>Indicator variables can be also used when binding input data, to
control whether the data is to be used as provided, or explicitly
overrided to be null: </p>
<pre>int id = 7;<br>string name;<br>eIndicator ind = eNull;<br>sql &lt;&lt; "insert into person(id, name) values(:id, :name)",<br>       use(id), use(name, ind);<br></pre>
<p>In the above example, the row is inserted with <code>name</code>
attribute set to null. </p>
<h4><a name="preparation"></a>Statement preparation and repeated
execution</h4>
<p>Consider the following examples: </p>
<pre>// Example 1.<br>for (int i = 0; i != 100; ++i)<br>{<br>    sql &lt;&lt; "insert into numbers(value) values(" &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; ")";<br>}<br><br>// Example 2.<br>for (int i = 0; i != 100; ++i)<br>{<br>    sql &lt;&lt; "insert into numbers(value) values(:val)", use(i);<br>}<br></pre>
<p>Both examples will populate the table <code>numbers</code> with the
values from <code>0</code> to <code>99</code>.<br>
The
problem is that in both examples, not only the statement execution is
repeated 100 times, but also the statement parsing and preparation.
This means unnecessary overhead.<br>
The following example uses the class <code>Statement</code>
explicitly, by preparing the statement only once and repeating its
execution with changing data (note the use of <code>prepare</code>
member of <code>Session</code> class): </p>
<pre>int i;<br>Statement st = (sql.prepare &lt;&lt;<br>                "insert into numbers(value) values(:val)",<br>                use(i));<br>for (i = 0; i != 100; ++i)<br>{<br>    st.execute(1);<br>}<br></pre>
<p>The <code>1</code> parameter given to the <code>execute</code>
method indicates the number of times the statement has to be executed.
Here, it is executed <i>once</i> in each body of the loop. </p>
<p>It is also possible to read all the numbers written in the above
example: </p>
<pre>int i;<br>Statement st = (sql.prepare &lt;&lt;<br>                "select value from numbers order by value",<br>                into(i));<br>st.execute();<br>while (st.fetch())<br>{<br>    cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; '\n';<br>}<br></pre>
<p>In the above example, the <code>execute</code> method is called
with the default parameter <code>0</code>. The following <code>fetch</code>
calls perform the actual data retrieval and cursor traversal. The
end-of-cursor condition is indicated by the <code>fetch</code>
function returning <code>false</code>. </p>
<h4><a name="transactions"></a>Transactions</h4>
<p>The <code>Session</code> class provides two methods for transaction
processing: <code>commit</code> and <code>rollback</code>.
The transaction is implicitly started with the first statement that
modifies data in the database. </p>
<h4><a name="advanced"></a>Advanced stuff</h4>
<p>If there is any need to use more advanced features of the underlying
OCI library (special connection steps, attribute manipulation,
call-back functions, etc.), it can be done by accessing the low-level
OCI handles available as public (see rationale below) members of the <code>Session</code>
and <code>Statement</code> classes. Please refer to the <code>soci.h</code>
file to see exactly what handles are available. </p>
<p> </p>
<h4><b><a name="rationale"></a></b>Rationale for some design decisions</h4>
<p>Since public data members are considered harmful amongst C++
programmers, some explanation is in order to defend SOCI against
anticipated criticism.
The intent is to allow reading, writing and object modifications
through the low-level OCI handles, to enable experienced programmers to
reuse SOCI in most demanding situations. The usual approach would be to
provide the public getter/setter method pairs for private handles.
However, OCI handles are opaque pointers and are strong abstractions by
themselves - this is what makes them different from data members of
standard types (like <code>int</code> or <code>string</code>). The
getter/setter pairs (or even single accessors returning non-const
references) <i>were</i>
considered in the library design, but abandoned due to the lack of any
real benefits. The only argument for providing getter/setter
abstractions would be to allow future replacements of low-level OCI
handles with "something else", but the reality is that OCI handles
exist in a specific family and that "something else" (like handles for
database other than Oracle) would not map into those abstrations.
Porting the SOCI library to support other databases would require to
change not only low-level handles, but also the getter/setter pairs,
which would then prove to be not really abstract. Uff...<br>
Having said that, it has to be reiterated that public data members are
generally bad. </p>
