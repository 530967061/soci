Compilation instructions (Linux) for impatient users:

$ cd core
$ make
$ cd ../backends/oracle
$ make
$ cd test
$ make

Note: The Makefiles for each backend and their tests contain variables
that need to be set up properly with regard to the local environment.
Their current values are correct on our development machines, but might
need to be modified to work elsewhere.
Please review the first few lines of each Makefile.
