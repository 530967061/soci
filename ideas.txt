This file contains a raw bunch of ideas for future releases.
Not all of these ideas will necessarily make sense - they are here to get them together.

---
RAII for transactions.

---
bjam

---
Refactoring of core, more fine-grained file structure.

---
Session constructor overload that accepts map<string,string> for param=value pairs.
This should rather be provided as a separate function?

---
Query construction utilities (kind of Ultimate++) - can be easily incorporated into SOCI by just making them streamable.
