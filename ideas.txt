This file contains a raw bunch of ideas for future releases.
Not all of these ideas will necessarily make sense - they are here to get them together.

---
RAII for transactions.

---
bjam

---
Refactoring of core, more fine-grained file structure.

---
Session constructor overload that accepts map<string,string> for param=value pairs.
This should rather be provided as a separate function?

---
Query construction utilities (kind of Ultimate++) - can be easily incorporated into SOCI by just making them streamable.

---
CLOB

---
Streaming interface for BLOB

---
Standard names for Session constructor.

---
wstring

---
Handle locales in Session (so that operator<< is immune to strange global locale in the user program). It might even make sense to expose imbue(), so that users set up whatever locale they want.
It might even make sense to expose the whole stream object.
Alternatively, the backend should decide on the locale, because the backend will know best how to format numbers, dates, etc.

---
sql << "select...", into(x, default(7));

Note: default is a reserved word.

---
Provide statement-wide flag for eNoData case (because actually it *is* statement-wide, not field-wide). With this, boost.optional would handle the eNull case and the indicators could be dropped.

---
Session sql("mysql://user:password@host/database");

So that Session tries to find backend_mysql.(dll|so) if not yet registered.
